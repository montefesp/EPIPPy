    """
    Apply a special Voronoi partition of a non-convex polygon based on an approximation of the
    geodesic distance to a set of points which define the centroids of each partition.

    Parameters
    ----------
    shape: Union[Polygon, MultiPolygon]
        Non-convex shape
    centroids: List[List[float]], shape: Nx2
        List of coordinates
    resolution: float (default: 0.5)
        The smaller this value the more precise the geodesic approximation

    Returns

    List of N Polygons
